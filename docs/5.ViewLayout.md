## How to override Admin controller view

Override the built in Controller view

### Solution

1. In your module, under the view directory, create the folder tree zfc-admin/admin
2. Create the necessary override view scripts, depending on which page(s) you want to change:
    * Default page: zfc-admin/admin/index.phtml


NOTE: Your module must be loaded after ZfcAdmin or the overriding will not work.  To do this, place your module after ZfcAdmin in the `modules` key of your application configuration (`config/application.config.php`).
